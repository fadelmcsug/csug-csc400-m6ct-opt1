# Custom Linked List
This Java program provides a custom implementation of a linked list, including methods for inserting and deleting elements, as well as iterating through the list. It also implements a test class to demonstrate its functionalities by creating two linked lists and using them to insert and delete integer data, in addition to importing some of the data from a specified text file to a linked list.
